# MetaRL_heartsound
This is a project we started for EMBC2025. In this project, we extracted spectrograms from existing heart sound data and reimplemented the spectrograms into a grid world to set up a reinforcement learning environment. Then, we trained and evaluated agents using two reinforcement learning algorithms, A2C and PPO, in this environment. In addition, to solve the inherent problems of medical data, we tried to train an agent that can perform generalized performance with less data using MAML.
